# SBSPS-Challenge-7273: SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

## Overview

This project, developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2020, addresses **Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger**. Our team, RSNV, has implemented a model to predict crop yields and provide insightful visualizations to aid in understanding agricultural trends.

## Repository Structure

- **Model Algorithm**:
  - `Hackathon_Main.ipynb`: The primary notebook containing the model implementation.

- **Visualizations**:
  - `pi_chart.ipynb`: Generates pie charts for data representation.
  - `yeild_over_the_years.ipynb`: Analyzes crop yield trends over the years.
  - `Visualization_2.ipynb`: Additional visualizations to support data analysis.

- **Poster**:
  - `Poster_RSNV.pdf`: A poster summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and findings.

- **Summary**:
  - `Summary.html`: A brief overview of the project.

- **Presentation**:
  - `presentation_RSNV.mp4`: A video presentation detailing the project's scope and results.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitin-varma/-SBSPS-Challenge-7273-SDG-2-Zero-Hunger-P.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd -SBSPS-Challenge-7273-SDG-2-Zero-Hunger-P
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to review the model and visualizations.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, xgboost)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list all dependencies. If it's not present, manually install the libraries used in the notebooks.*

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for crop yields, assisting in achieving zero hunger by providing insights into agricultural productivity.

## Methodology

We employed the **XGBoost regression algorithm** to predict crop yields based on historical data. The model's performance was evaluated, and various visualizations were created to interpret the results effectively.

## Results

The model demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting crop yields. The visualizations offer a clear understanding of agricultural trends, which can be instrumental for policymakers and farmers in decision-making processes.
